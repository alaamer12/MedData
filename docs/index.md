# MedData Engineering Hub Documentation

Welcome to the MedData Engineering Hub documentation. This guide provides an overview of our project, its purpose, and how to use our datasets effectively.

## About MedData Engineering Hub

MedData Engineering Hub is a comprehensive resource for data scientists, researchers, and developers working with text data. We provide meticulously curated datasets from various online publishing platforms, focusing on content that can be valuable for natural language processing, machine learning, and data science applications.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to democratize access to high-quality, structured data for research and application development. We believe that by providing clean, well-documented datasets, we can accelerate innovation in fields such as:

- Natural Language Processing
- Content Analysis
- Recommendation Systems
- Machine Learning Research
- Text Classification
- Topic Modeling

## Datasets Overview

MedData Engineering Hub currently offers the following datasets:

### Medium Articles Dataset

A comprehensive collection of 500,000+ articles from Medium with rich metadata, including author information, engagement metrics, and full article content. Perfect for content analysis, NLP research, and recommendation systems.

**Status:** Available  
**Access:** [Dataset Page]({{ site.baseurl }}/dataset/medium/) | [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Alaamer/medium-articles-posts-with-content)

### Dev.to Articles Dataset

A specialized collection of technical articles from Dev.to containing code snippets, technical discussions, and developer community metrics. Ideal for software engineering research, programming education, and technical documentation analysis.

**Status:** In Development (Coming Q2 2025)
