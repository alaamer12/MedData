## Data Processing Methodology

The dataset is being developed with the following processing pipeline:

1. **Collection**: Ethical scraping of publicly available Dev.to articles
2. **Cleaning**: Structured formatting and noise removal
3. **Code Extraction**: Identification and parsing of code snippets with language detection
4. **Metadata Enhancement**: Adding computed metrics and cross-references
5. **Quality Assurance**: Manual verification of a sample subset
6. **Anonymization**: Removal of personally identifiable information where appropriate

## Ethical Considerations

- All content will be collected in accordance with Dev.to's terms of service
- Author attribution will be maintained for proper citation
- Focus will be placed on educational and research applications
- Personal or sensitive information in code examples will be sanitized

## Preview Access

While the full dataset is in development, researchers can request access to a preview subset containing approximately 10,000 articles for preliminary work:

1. **Preview Dataset**:
   ```python
   from datasets import load_dataset
   preview = load_dataset("Alaamer/devto-articles-preview")
   ```

2. **Early Access Program**: Researchers can apply to join our early access program to help shape the dataset development
